# BERT-based Transformer Model

## Description
This project provides an implementation of a BERT-based Transformer model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and loading
- Custom BERT-based Transformer architecture
- Model training and validation
- Performance analysis with visualizations

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meet2121/BERT-based-Transformer-model.git
cd BERT-based-Transformer-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Open `BERT-based_Transformer_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the model.

## Example
See example results and analysis directly in the notebook.
